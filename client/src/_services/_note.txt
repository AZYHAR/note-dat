Handles all http communication with backend apis for the application, 
each service encapsulates the api calls for a content type (e.g. users) and exposes methods 
for performing various operations (e.g. CRUD operations). Services can also have methods that 
don't wrap http calls, for example the userService.logout() method just removes an item from local storage.

Wrapping http calls and implementation details in a services layer, it provides a clean 
separation of concerns and simplifies the redux actions (and other modules) that use the services.
